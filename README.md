# React Town Tune
[andrewlehman.me/town-tune](http://andrewlehman.me/town-tune)

React web app based on Animal Crossing's Town Tune feature. Utilizes the Web Audio API.

Designed for desktop browsers but should work on mobile.

This project is far from finished, but I probably won't work on it anymore. My current project in my apprenticeship is to rebuild this app from scratch using TDD and Angular. If you want to work on it, feel free to fork this repo and do whatever you want. If you make a PR, I'll take a look. Or just keep your repo separate and do your own thing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
